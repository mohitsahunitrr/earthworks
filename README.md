## Python Earthworks

Welcome to the Python Earthworks program.

### Why?
For computing cut and fill volumes required for leveling terrains on electrical substations construction sites.

### How does it work?
Given a .gpx file obtained from a GPS survey, the construciton area (a rectangle delimited by 4 GPS points) and a reference elevation this application will compute the required cut and fill volumes for leveling the terrain to that reference and plot corresponding graphs.

### Important: Setting up Plotly api_key
As a safety measure, API keys are not hardcoded. Please setup your own key when using the program.
In Terminal:
export MY_API_KEY='bdfr43lkjfr35'
